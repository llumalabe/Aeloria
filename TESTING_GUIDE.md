```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Ronin Wallet not found"
- **Solution**: Install Ronin Wallet extension from https://wallet.roninchain.com/

### "Not Connected" (red dot)

- If still fails: Refresh page and try again

### "Wrong network"
- **Solution**: App will auto-prompt to switch to Ronin Saigon
- Or manually: Ronin Wallet settings ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Saigon Testnet

### "Insufficient funds" error
- **For AETH deposits**: Make sure you have AETH in your Ronin Wallet
- **For RON deposits**: Make sure you have RON in your Ronin Wallet
- **For any transaction**: Always keep at least 0.001 RON for gas fees

### "Approval failed"
- **Solution**: This is transaction #1 for AETH deposits
- Check you have enough RON for gas
- Try increasing gas limit in Ronin Wallet settings

### Transaction stuck

3. Deposit 50 AETH to game
4. Play game, earn in-game currency

## üö® Known Limitations (Current Version)

1. **Backend Not Synced**: Backend database doesn't verify blockchain transactions yet
   - Game balances (Gold, Premium) are separate from on-chain balances
   - Future: Backend will read from blockchain as source of truth

2. **No Event Listeners**: App doesn't listen to contract events
   - Must manually refresh to see other users' transactions
   - Future: WebSocket connection to monitor events

3. **No Transaction History**: Only shows current balance
   - Can't see past deposits/withdrawals in UI
   - Must check Ronin explorer for history
   - Future: Transaction history table

4. **Testnet Only**: Not deployed to mainnet
   - Test tokens have no real value
   - For production: Deploy to Ronin mainnet

## üìù Next Steps for Production

1. **Deploy to Mainnet**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npm run deploy:mainnet
   ```

2. **Update Frontend Config**
   ```typescript
   // src/config/contracts.ts
   export const CONTRACTS = {
     AETH_TOKEN: 'MAINNET_AETH_ADDRESS',
     WALLET_MANAGER: 'MAINNET_WALLET_ADDRESS',
   };
   ```

3. **Add Backend Verification**
   - Verify all transactions on-chain before updating database
   - Listen to contract events for real-time sync

4. **Implement Transaction Queue**
   - Handle multiple pending transactions
   - Show transaction status (pending, confirmed, failed)

5. **Add Analytics**
   - Track total deposits/withdrawals
   - Monitor fee collection
   - User transaction volume
